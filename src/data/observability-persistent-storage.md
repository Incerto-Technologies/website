### **Introduction**
By default, OpenTelemetry OTLP exporters (and other exporters too) send telemetry data directly to the specified endpoint. While this is effective in many scenarios, there are situations where transient network issues or destination unavailability may result in the loss of telemetry data.

To address this, OpenTelemetry provides an option to use persistent storage for the exporter. With persistent storage enabled, the exporter writes the telemetry data to local storage first before attempting to transmit it to the destination. This ensures that the data is retained in case of network interruptions, and the exporter can continue the transmission once the connectivity is restored.

### **Benefits of Persistent Storage**
Enabling persistent storage for your OpenTelemetry OTLP exporter offers several benefits:
- Reliability: Data is stored locally, reducing the risk of data loss during network interruptions.
- Flexibility: You can choose where to store the data, allowing you to leverage existing storage solutions or customize based on your infrastructure.
- Recovery: In the event of a transmission failure, the exporter can resume sending data once connectivity is restored, ensuring no telemetry data is left behind.

### **Configuration**
The config for `OTLP` exporter and `file storage` extension might look something like this-
```yaml
otlp:
  endpoint: ${env:OTEL_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT}
  tls:
    insecure: true
  retry_on_failure:
    enabled: true
    initial_interval: 5s
    max_interval: 30s
    max_elapsed_time: 3600s
  sending_queue:
    enabled: true
    num_consumers: 10
    queue_size: 10000
    storage: file_storage/otlp
  timeout: 5s
```
```yaml
file_storage/otlp:
  directory: /var/lib/otelcol/file_storage
  timeout: 1s
```
Find the full settings for OTLP exporter [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/exporter/exporterhelper/README.md) and for file storage extension [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/extension/storage/filestorage).

### **Conclusion**
By incorporating persistent storage for OTLP exporters in your OpenTelemetry Collector configuration, you enhance the durability and scalability of your telemetry data. This ensures that your observability efforts remain robust and reliable, providing valuable insights into your applications' performance over time. Explore the documentation of your chosen storage system and the OpenTelemetry Collector for advanced configurations and optimizations.

Happy exporting!
