## **Challenge**

### **Grappling with high volumes, inadequate retention, and compliance gaps**

The client, a leading brokerage firm in India, grappled with intricate observability challenges inherent in high volumes of trade. Existing solutions fell short in critical areas, from tracing capabilities to recovery times, impacting operational efficiency. With no single observability solution meeting all requirements, vendor scaling was difficult and expensive. The demand for scalability, log processing struggled during peak traffic hours, and stringent compliance standards further intensified the need for a transformative observability solution.

## **Solution**

### **Custom observability powered by OSS (OpenTelemetry) built on the client’s infrastructure**

- Leveraging OpenTelemetry, we systematically instrumented, generated, collected, and exported telemetry data. This meticulous approach addressed the tracing gaps, significantly reducing Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) from hours to minutes, thus enhancing overall system reliability.
- Introducing a robust ClickHouse cluster, we overcame the challenge of scaling and retaining telemetry data. Now, the brokerage firm can store billions of rows efficiently, ensuring quick and reliable access to historical data for SIEM compliance needs.
- Incorporated Grafana for visualization, analysis, and alerting. This not only simplified the interpretation of telemetry data but also empowered proactive decision-making, mitigating challenges in correlating low cardinality telemetry data across various services.

## **Impact**

- Reduced costs: Slashed IT costs by 85% (One-time turnkey implementation, hence no recurring subscription fees).
- High efficiency: MTTR reduction from hours to minutes.
- Customized insights: Tailored team dashboards for C-Level, Product, and Developer verticals and status page for clients.
- Vendor-agnostic solution: Streamlined operations with no reliance on multiple vendors.

## **Say goodbye to costly subscriptions**

Experience vendor-agnostic excellence at a fraction of the cost.
